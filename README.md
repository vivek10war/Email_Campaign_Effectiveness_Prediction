PROJECT SUMMARY:
The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can characterize and track emails sent through Gmail-based email marketing campaigns. This model will be used by small to medium business owners who are looking to improve the effectiveness of their email marketing efforts and increase customer retention.

One of the main challenges in email marketing is determining which emails are being read, ignored, or acknowledged by the reader. By understanding which emails are most effective at engaging the reader, business owners can tailor their marketing efforts and increase their chances of success.

To address this problem, we will gather data on a variety of email characteristics, including the subject line, sender name, email content, email format, and email frequency. We will also consider the target audience of the emails and any other relevant factors.

Using this data, we will train a machine learning model to predict whether an email is likely to be read, ignored, or acknowledged by the reader. This model will be able to analyze new emails and provide a prediction of how they are likely to be received by the reader.

To evaluate the performance of the model, we will split our data into a training set and a testing set. We will use the training set to fit the model and the testing set to evaluate its performance. We will use a variety of metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1 score, to assess the model's accuracy and effectiveness.

Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed in a production environment to help small to medium business owners improve the effectiveness of their email marketing campaigns. By using the model to characterize and track emails, they will be able to make more informed decisions about how to target their marketing efforts and increase customer retention.

Overall, this project aims to provide small to medium business owners with a powerful tool for improving the effectiveness of their email marketing campaigns. By using machine learning to characterize and track emails, they will be able to make more informed decisions and increase the chances of success for their marketing efforts.


CONCLUSIONS:
**Customer Location Impact:** Analysis shows that the customer's location has minimal influence on whether emails are ignored, opened, or acknowledged. Therefore, location-based targeting might not significantly impact email engagement metrics.

**Email Campaign Type Effectiveness:** Campaign Type 1 had a high open and acknowledgment rate despite fewer emails sent. In contrast, Campaign Type 2 resulted in a high proportion of ignored emails. Campaign Type 3 achieved a balanced read and acknowledgment rate despite fewer emails sent, indicating its effectiveness.

**Email Sent Time Relevance:** The time category of email sends showed that emails sent in Category 2 (mid-day) had higher engagement rates compared to Category 1 and Category 3. This suggests that timing plays a crucial role in email engagement.

**Email Volume and Engagement:** A positive correlation was observed between the volume of emails sent and the number of emails read and acknowledged. Building customer relationships through increased communication appears beneficial.

**Email Length Impact:** Longer emails tended to be ignored more frequently, indicating that concise and focused communication may improve engagement rates.

**Email Content Elements:** Emails with more images were more likely to be ignored, suggesting that image-heavy content may not always resonate well with recipients.

**Handling Outliers:** Except for Word Count, most continuous variables had outliers. Retaining these outliers, which represent more than 5% of the minority data, was deemed necessary to avoid biasing the results.

**Effect of Sampling Techniques:** SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) improved performance by addressing class imbalance, albeit with potential information loss.

**Model Performance**: XGBoost demonstrated robust performance on our dataset with unbalanced classes and outliers, achieving an F1 Score of 0.68 on the test set. This was followed by the Random Forest model with hyperparameter tuning, which also showed competitive performance.

These insights are derived from our analysis of feature importance and model performance, providing actionable strategies for optimizing email campaign effectiveness and engagement metrics.
